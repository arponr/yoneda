                  Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie. This is some serious gourmet
                  shit. Usually, me and Vince would be happy with some
                  freeze-dried Taster's Choice, right? And he springs
                  this serious gourmet shit on us. What flavor is this?

                  I don't need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee
                  is, okay? I'm the one who buys it, I know how good it
                  is. When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit. Me, I
                  buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink
                  it, I want to taste it. But you know what's on my mind
                  right now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the
                  dead nigger in my garage.

                  No, I wanna ask you a question. When you came pullin'
                  in here, did you notice a sign out in front of my
                  house that said "Dead Nigger Storage"?

                  No, no, no, no, no, don't you fucking realize, man,
                  that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her
                  house, I'm gonna get divorced? All right? No marriage
                  counseling, no trial separation, I'm going to get
                  fucking divorced, okay? And I don't want to get
                  fucking divorced. Now man, you know, fuck, I wanna
                  help you, but I don't want to lose my wife doing it,

                  Don't fucking "Jimmie" me, Jules, okay? Don't fucking
                  "Jimmie" me. There's nothing that you're gonna say
                  that's gonna make me forget that I love my wife, is
                  there? Now look, you know, she comes home from work in
                  about an hour and a half. Graveyard shift at the
                  hospital. You gotta make some phone calls? You gotta
                  call some people? Well, then do it. And then get the
                  fuck out of my house before she gets here.
